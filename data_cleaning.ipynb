    "We have successfully cleaned our data into a new table. Next, new columns will need to be made in order for more efficient analysis of the dataset. New columns that tell us the month, day of the week, distance travelled, total travel time, etc. will need to be added. This is because we want to be able to understand more about customer trends with more informative metrics as we move onto the analysis phase of the data cycle. By adding new columns with new data and metrics, we can gain more insights on rider behaviour and create informative visuals to present to our stakeholders."
